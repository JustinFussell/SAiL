"What is 3/4 of 24?","Divide 24 by 4 to get one part: 24 ÷ 4 = 6. Multiply by 3: 6 × 3 = 18. So, 3/4 of 24 is 18."
"What is 0.75 as a fraction?","Write 0.75 as 75/100. Simplify by dividing by 25: 75 ÷ 25 = 3, 100 ÷ 25 = 4. So, 0.75 = 3/4."
"What is 2/5 + 1/5?","Add numerators: 2 + 1 = 3. Keep denominator: 5. So, 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5."
"What is 1/3 of 18?","Divide 18 by 3: 18 ÷ 3 = 6. So, 1/3 of 18 is 6."
"Convert 25% to a decimal.","Divide by 100: 25 ÷ 100 = 0.25. So, 25% = 0.25."
"Convert 1/2 to a percentage.","Divide: 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5. Multiply by 100: 0.5 × 100 = 50%. So, 1/2 = 50%."
"What is 2^3?","Calculate 2 × 2 × 2: 2 × 2 = 4, 4 × 2 = 8. So, 2^3 = 8."
"Solve for x: 3x = 12.","Divide both sides by 3: x = 12 ÷ 3 = 4. So, x = 4."
"What is the value of 5! (factorial)?","Calculate 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1: 5 × 4 = 20, 20 × 3 = 60, 60 × 2 = 120, 120 × 1 = 120. So, 5! = 120."
"What is 4^2?","Calculate 4 × 4: 4 × 4 = 16. So, 4^2 = 16."
"Solve for y: 2y + 5 = 11.","Subtract 5: 2y = 11 − 5 = 6. Divide by 2: y = 6 ÷ 2 = 3. So, y = 3."
"Solve x^2 = 16.","Take the square root: x = ±√16 = ±4. So, x = 4 or x = −4."
"Solve for x: 2x^2 − 8 = 0.","Add 8: 2x^2 = 8. Divide by 2: x^2 = 4. Take the square root: x = ±2. So, x = 2 or x = −2."
"Simplify: 2x + 3x.","Combine like terms: 2x + 3x = 5x. So, the answer is 5x."
"Solve for x: x/4 = 8.","Multiply both sides by 4: x = 8 × 4 = 32. So, x = 32."
"Simplify: (2x^2)(3x^3).","Multiply coefficients: 2 × 3 = 6. Add exponents: x^2 × x^3 = x^(2+3) = x^5. So, the answer is 6x^5."
"Simplify: (x^4)/(x^2).","Subtract exponents: x^4 ÷ x^2 = x^(4−2) = x^2. So, the answer is x^2."
"Solve: x^2 − 5x + 6 = 0.","Factorize: (x − 2)(x − 3) = 0. So, x = 2 or x = 3."
"Solve: 2x^2 + 3x − 5 = 0.","Use quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b^2 − 4ac)] / 2a, where a=2, b=3, c=−5. Discriminant: 3^2 − 4(2)(−5) = 9 + 40 = 49. x = [-3 ± √49] / 4 = [-3 ± 7] / 4. So, x = 1 or x = −2.5."
"Simplify: (3x^2)^3.","Raise to power: (3x^2)^3 = 3^3 × (x^2)^3 = 27x^6. So, the answer is 27x^6."
